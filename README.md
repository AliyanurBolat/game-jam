README

To install the game, download the archive Run for your life! 0.2.rar. Then, copy all files to the desired location.

To run the game, open .exe file following this path: game >> dist >> main.exe

The game should start right after you open main.exe, if not, there is/are missing files in the dist folder. 

If .exe doesn't run it will show you what files are missing and in which folder they're must be in dist.

If after opening the game your character is out of sight or fell under the map, reopen the game.

Antivirus may not allow you to run .exe file. This is okay, just put it in exceptions list. A reason for this may be because game was wrapped with just pyinstaller library.
